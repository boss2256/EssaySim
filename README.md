# EssaySimScore üìùüß†

## Introduction

EssaySimScore is an advanced semantic similarity analysis tool designed to compare two texts and provide deep insights into their conceptual relatedness. Unlike traditional plagiarism checkers, this tool uses state-of-the-art AI embeddings to understand the semantic meaning behind words and sentences.

## Background

In the era of digital content and academic writing, understanding the similarity between texts goes beyond simple word-for-word matching. Traditional plagiarism detection tools often rely on exact string matching or n-gram comparisons, which can miss nuanced similarities or fail to capture the underlying semantic meaning.

EssaySimScore addresses this limitation by leveraging advanced natural language processing techniques, specifically transformer-based embeddings, to:
- Analyze semantic similarity
- Provide word-level contribution analysis
- Visualize conceptual relationships between texts

## Key Technologies

### Core Technologies
- **Sentence Transformers**: Uses state-of-the-art transformer models for semantic embedding
- **SentenceTransformer Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2 for efficient semantic analysis
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive web application
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Machine Learning**: Semantic similarity calculation

### Technical Features
- Semantic similarity scoring (0-1 range)
- Word-level similarity analysis
- Interactive heatmap visualization
- Stopword removal option
- Support for .txt and .docx file uploads

## How It Works

1. **Text Input**: Users can input text directly or upload files
2. **Embedding**: Texts are converted to dense vector representations
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity between embeddings is computed
4. **Analysis**: 
   - Overall similarity score
   - Word-by-word semantic contribution
   - Heatmap visualization of word similarities

## Use Cases

### Academic
- Detecting potential plagiarism
- Assessing essay originality
- Comparing research papers
- Checking citation paraphrasing

## Commercial Alternatives

### Plagiarism Checkers
1. **Turnitin**
   - Most widely used in academic institutions
   - Extensive database of academic content
   - Provides detailed originality reports
   - Expensive, primarily for institutional use

2. **Grammarly Plagiarism Checker**
   - Integrated with writing improvement tools
   - Web and academic content scanning
   - Less expensive than Turnitin
   - Primarily web-based

3. **Quillbot Plagiarism Checker**
   - Part of paraphrasing tool suite
   - Web and academic content scanning
   - More affordable
   - Less comprehensive than Turnitin

## Advantages Over Alternatives

- **Open-Source**: Fully customizable
- **Local Processing**: No external data uploads
- **Semantic Analysis**: Goes beyond simple string matching
- **Detailed Visualization**: Word-level contribution heatmap
- **Lightweight**: Low computational requirements
